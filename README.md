This is a single page application (SPA) which can be used to time and keep track of the amount of time that the user spends playing a game, 
versus the amount of time they spend studying or working. 

On the initial load, the app fetches a set of data from a JSON file, which it uses to populate the table and calendar views.

There is also a timer page where the user can start a timer for their game time and study time and save the two to the table independently.
once the user is done for the day, they can save the data in the table to the calendar, which updates the calendar view and wipes the table, ready for the next day.
Clicking on each day in the calendar will display the total amount of time spent doing each gaming and studying, as well as a breakdown of each individual task of that day.
